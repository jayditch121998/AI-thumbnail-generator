This project template was created through collaboration between human developers and AI (Claude) to provide a robust starting point for Next.js applications.

## ü§ù Human + AI Collaboration

This template represents a fusion of human expertise and AI assistance, specifically:

- **Human**: Project structure decisions, best practices validation, and real-world requirements definition
- **AI (Claude)**: Configuration assistance, documentation generation, and code organization recommendations

## üìÅ Project Structure

## Getting started
To create a new project, you go to `/paths`, choose from our list of Paths, and then use Cursor's Composer feature to quickly scaffold your project!

You can also edit the Path's prompt template to be whatever you like!

This doesn't really matter, but is useful for the AI to understand more about this project. We are using the following technologies
- React with Next.js 14 App Router
- TailwindCSS
- Firebase Auth, Storage, and Database
- Multiple AI endpoints including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Replicate using Vercel's AI SDK
